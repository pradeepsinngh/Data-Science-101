## Faithfulness:

We describe a dataset as "faithful" if we believe it accurately captures reality. Typically, untrustworthy datasets contain:

1. Unrealistic or incorrect values
For example, dates in the future, locations that don't exist, negative counts, or large outliers.

2. Violations of obvious dependencies
For example, age and birthday for individuals don't match.

3. Hand-entered data
For eg: spelling errors and inconsistencies.

4. Clear signs of data falsification
For example, repeated names, fake looking email addresses, or repeated use of uncommon names or fields.
