# Visualization Principles

There are general principles that make visualizations much more effective at showing trends in the data. And the most important  principles are: scale, conditioning, perception, transformation, context, and smoothing.

## Principle of Scale:
- Principles of scale relate to the choice of x and y-axis used to plot the data. 
- When we select the x and y-axis for our plot, we should keep a consistent scale across the entire axis. 
- When selecting the x and y-axis limits we prefer to focus on the region with the bulk of the data, especially when working with long-tailed data.

## Principle of Conditioning:
- Principles of conditioning give us techniques to show distributions and relationships between subgroups of our data.

## Principles of Perception:
- Human perception has specific properties that are important to consider in visualization design. 
- We perceive some colors more strongly than others, especially green colors. 
- We perceive lighter shaded areas as larger than darker shaded ones. 

## Principles of Transformation:
- data transformation give us useful ways to alter data for visualization in order to more effectively reveal trends. 
- We most commonly apply data transformations to reveal patterns in skewed data and non-linear relationships between variables.

## Principles of Context:
- Always add as much relevant context as possible to any plot you plan to share more broadly.
- To provide context, we add a title, caption, axes labels, units for the axes, and labels for the plotted lines.

- In general, we provide context for a plot through:

    Plot title
    Axes labels
    Reference lines and markers for important values
    Labels for interesting points and unusual observations
    Captions that describe the data and its important features
