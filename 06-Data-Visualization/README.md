## Data Visualization:

Data visualization is an essential tool for data science at every step of analysis, from data cleaning to EDA to communicating conclusions and predictions. Because human minds are highly developed for visual perception, a well-chosen plot can often reveal trends and anomalies in the data much more efficiently than a textual description.

We will learn how to spot misleading visualizations and how to improve visualizations using data transformations, smoothing, and dimensionality reduction.

We generally use different types of charts to visualize quantitative (numerical) data and qualitative (ordinal or nominal) data.

### Visualizing Quantitative Data
For quantitative data, we most often use histograms, box plots, and scatter plots.

#### Box Plots
- Box plots are a convenient way to see where most of the data lie. 
- Typically, we use the 25th and 75th percentiles of the data as the start and endpoints of the box and draw a line within the box for the 50th percentile (the median). 

#### Scatter Plots
- Scatter plots are used to compare two quantitative variables.

### Visualizing Qualitative Data
For qualitative or categorical data, we most often use bar charts and dot charts.
