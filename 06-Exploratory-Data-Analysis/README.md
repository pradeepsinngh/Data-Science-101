# Exploratory Data Analysis

In EDA, we summarize, visualize, and transform the data in order to understand it more deeply. In particular, through EDA we identify potential issues in the data and discover trends that inform further analyses.

We seek to understand the following properties about our data:
- **Structure:** The format of our data file.
- **Granularity:** How fine or coarse each row and column is.
- **Scope:** How (in)complete our data are.
- **Temporality:** How the data are situation in time.
- **Faithfulness:** How well the data captures "reality".

Follow these checklist while you do EDA:
