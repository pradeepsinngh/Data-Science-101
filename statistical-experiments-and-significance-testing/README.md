## Statistical Experiments and Significance Testing

### Why to design experiments? 
In order to confirm or reject a hypothesis.

## Statistical Inference Pipeline:
```
Formulate Hypothesis > Design Experiment > Collect Data > Inference/ Conclusion
```

- **Step 1:** Formulate a hypothesis (“drug A is better than the existing standard drug,” “price A is more profitable than 
the existing price B”). 
- **Step 2:**  Design an experiment (it might be an A/B test) to test the hypothesis— design in such a way that, hopefully, 
will deliver conclusive results. 
- **Step 3:**  Data is collected and analyzed, and then a conclusion is drawn. 
- **Step 4:**  The term inference reflects the intention to apply the experiment results, which involve a limited set of data, to a larger process or population.
