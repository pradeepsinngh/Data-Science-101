## Exploring Two or More Variables:

- Familiar estimators like mean and variance look at variables one at a time **(univariate analysis)**. 
- Correlation analysis is an important method that compares two variables **(bivariate analysis)**. 

In this section we look at additional estimates and plots, and at more than two variables **(multivariate analysis)**.

1. Contingency tables : A tally of counts between two or more categorical variables.
2. Hexagonal binning : A plot of two numeric variables with the records binned into hexagons.
3. Contour plots : A plot showing the density of two numeric variables like a topographical map.
4. Violin plots : Similar to a boxplot but showing the density estimate.

To show the relationship between two numeric variables -- Heat maps, hexagonal binning, and contour plots all give a visual representation of a two-dimensional density. In this way, they are natural analogs to histograms and density plots.


### Two Categorical Variables
A useful way to summarize two categorical variables is a contingency table—a table of counts by category. 

### Categorical and Numeric Data

1. Boxplots are a simple way to visually compare the distributions of a numeric variable grouped according to a categorical variable. 

1. A violin plot, is an enhancement to the boxplot and plots the density estimate with the density on the y-axis. 
2. The density is mirrored and flipped over and the resulting shape is filled in, creating an image resembling a violin. 

- The violin plot can show nuances in the distribution that aren’t perceptible in a boxplot. 
- Boxplot more clearly shows the outliers in the data. 

### Visualizing Multiple Variables
The types of charts used to compare two variables—scatterplots, hexagonal binning, and boxplots—are readily extended to more variables through the notion of conditioning. 


## Key Ideas:
1. Hexagonal binning and contour plots are useful tools that permit graphical examination of two numeric variables at a time, without being overwhelmed by huge amounts of data.

2. Contingency tables are the standard tool for looking at the counts of two categorical variables.

3. Boxplots and violin plots allow you to plot a numeric variable against a categorical variable.
