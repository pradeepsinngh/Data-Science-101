## Data Distribution:

1. **Boxplot** : A plot introduced by Tukey as a quick way to visualize the distribution of data.
   - Synonyms : Box and whiskers plot

- Percentiles are also valuable to summarize the entire distribution. 
- It is common to report the quartiles (25th, 50th, and 75th percentiles) and the deciles (the 10th, 20th, …, 90th percentiles). 
- Percentiles are especially valuable to summarize the tails (the outer range) of the distribution. 

- Boxplots, are based on percentiles and give a quick way to visualize the distribution of data.
- The top and bottom of the box are the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively. 
- The median is shown by the horizontal line in the box. 
- The dashed lines, referred to as whiskers, extend from the top and bottom to indicate the range for the bulk of the data. 

2. **Frequency table and Histograms** : 
Freq table - A tally of the count of numeric data values that fall into a set of intervals (bins).
Hist - A plot of the frequency table with the bins on the x-axis and the count (or proportion) on the y-axis.

**NOTE:** Both frequency tables and percentiles summarize the data by creating bins. In general, quartiles and deciles will have the same count in each bin (equal-count bins), but the bin sizes will be different. The frequency table, by contrast, will have different counts in the bins (equal-size bins).

**NOTE:** In statistical theory, location and variability are referred to as the first and second moments of a distribution. The third and fourth moments are called skewness and kurtosis. Skewness refers to whether the data is skewed to larger or smaller values and kurtosis indicates the propensity of the data to have extreme values. Generally, metrics are not used to measure skewness and kurtosis; instead, these are discovered through visual displays.


4. **Density plot** : A smoothed version of the histogram, often based on a kernal density estimate.

- Related to the histogram is a density plot, which shows the distribution of data values as a continuous line.


## Key Ideas:
1. A frequency histogram plots frequency counts on the y-axis and variable values on the x-axis; it gives a sense of the distribution of the data at a glance.

2. A frequency table is a tabular version of the frequency counts found in a histogram.

3. A boxplot—with the top and bottom of the box at the 75th and 25th percentiles, respectively—also gives a quick sense of the distribution of the data; it is often used in side-by-side displays to compare distributions.

4. A density plot is a smoothed version of a histogram; it requires a function to estimate a plot based on the data.
