## Correlation

- Exploratory data analysis is many modeling projects (in data science) involves examining correlation among predictors, and 
between predictors and a target variable. 

- Variables X and Y are said to be positively correlated if high values of X go with high values of Y, and low values of X go with low values of Y. 
- If high values of X go with low values of Y, and vice versa, the variables are negatively correlated.


1. Correlation coefficient : A metric that measures the extent to which numeric variables are associated with one another (ranges from –1 to +1) and 0 indicate no correlation.
2. Correlation matrix : A table where the variables are shown on both rows and columns, and the cell values are the correlations between the variables.
3. Scatterplot : A plot in which the x-axis is the value of one variable, and the y-axis the value of another.
   - Scatterplots are fine when there is a relatively small number of data values. 

**NOTE:** Like the mean and standard deviation, the correlation coefficient is sensitive to outliers in the data.

## Key Ideas:
- The correlation coefficient measures the extent to which two variables are associated with one another.
  - When high values of v1 go with high values of v2, v1 and v2 are positively associated.
  - When high values of v1 are associated with low values of v2, v1 and v2 are negatively associated.
- The correlation coefficient is a standardized metric and ranges from –1 (perfect negative correlation) to +1 (perfect positive correlation).
- A correlation coefficient of 0 indicates no correlation, but be aware that random arrangements of data will produce both positive and negative values for the correlation coefficient just by chance.
