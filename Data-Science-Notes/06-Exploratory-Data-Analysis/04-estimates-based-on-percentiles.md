## Estimates Based on Percentiles:

A different approach to estimating dispersion is based on looking at the spread of the sorted data. 

Statistics based on sorted (ranked) data are referred to as order statistics.

### Range:
- The most basic measure is the range: the difference between the largest and smallest number. 
- The minimum and maximum values themselves are useful to know, and helpful in identifying outliers, but the range is extremely sensitive to outliers and not very useful as a general measure of dispersion in the data.
- To avoid the sensitivity to outliers, we can look at the range of the data after dropping values from each end. 


## Key Ideas:
1. The variance and standard deviation are the most widespread and routinely reported statistics of variability.
2. Both are sensitive to outliers.
3. More robust metrics include mean and median absolute deviations from the mean and percentiles (quantiles).
