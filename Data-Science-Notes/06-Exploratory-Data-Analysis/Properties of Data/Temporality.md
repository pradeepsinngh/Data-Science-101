## Temporality:

Temporality refers to how the data are situated in time and specifically to the date and time fields in the dataset. We seek to understand the following traits about these fields:

1. What is the meaning of the date and time fields in the dataset?
2. What representation do the date and time fields have in the data?
3. Are there strange timestamps that might represent null values?
