## Faithfulness:

We describe a dataset as "faithful" if we believe it accurately captures reality. Typically, untrustworthy datasets contain:

1. Unrealistic or incorrect values
   - For example, dates in the future, locations that don't exist, negative counts, or large outliers.

2. Violations of obvious dependencies
   - For example, age and birthday for individuals don't match.

3. Hand-entered data
   - For eg: spelling errors and inconsistencies.

4. Clear signs of data falsification
   - For example, repeated names, fake looking email addresses, or repeated use of uncommon names or fields.
