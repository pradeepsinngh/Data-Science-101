## Scope:

The scope of the dataset refers to the coverage of the dataset in relation to what we are interested in analyzing. We seek to answer the following question about our data scope:

### Does the data cover the topic of interest?
For example, the [Calls and Stops datasets](https://data.cityofberkeley.info/Public-Safety/Berkeley-PD-Stop-Data/6e9j-pj9p) contain call and stop incidents made in Berkeley. If we are interested in crime incidents in the state of California, however, these datasets will be too limited in scope.

In general, larger scope is more useful than smaller scope since we can filter larger scope down to a smaller scope but often can't go from smaller scope to larger scope. For example, if we had a dataset of police stops in the United States we could subset the dataset to investigate Berkeley.
