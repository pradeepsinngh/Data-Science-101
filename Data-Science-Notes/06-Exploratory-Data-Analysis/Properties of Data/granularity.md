## Granularity:

The granularity of your data is what each record in your data represents. It determines what kind of analyses you can perform. Generally speaking, too fine of a granularity is better than too coarse; while we can use grouping and pivoting to change a fine granularity to a coarse one, we have few tools to go from coarse to fine.


### Granularity Checklist:

You should have answers to the following questions after looking at the granularity of your datasets.

1. What does a record represent?
2. Do all records capture granularity at the same level? (Sometimes a table will contain summary rows.)
3. If the data were aggregated, how was the aggregation performed? Sampling and averaging are are common aggregations.
4. What kinds of aggregations can we perform on the data?
