## Exploring Binary and Categorical Data:

For categorical data, simple proportions or percentages tell the story of the data.

1. Mode : The most commonly occurring category or value in a data set.
2. Expected value : When the categories can be associated with a numeric value, this gives an average value based on a category’s probability of occurrence.
3. Bar charts : The frequency or proportion for each category plotted as bars.
4. Pie charts : The frequency or proportion for each category plotted as wedges in a pie.

### Bar charts:
Bar charts are a common visual tool for displaying a single categorical variable, often seen in the popular press. Categories 
are listed on the x-axis, and frequencies or proportions on the y-axis.

**Note** that a bar chart resembles a histogram; in a bar chart the x-axis represents different categories of a factor 
variable, while in a histogram the x-axis represents values of a single variable on a numeric scale. In a histogram, the 
bars are typically shown touching each other, with gaps indicating values that did not occur in the data. In a bar chart, 
the bars are shown separate from one another.

### Pie Charts:
Pie charts are an alternative to bar charts, although statisticians and data visualization experts generally eschew pie 
charts as less visually informative.

## Numerical Data as Categorical Data
- In “Frequency Table and Histograms”, we looked at frequency tables based on binning the data. This implicitly converts the numeric data to an ordered factor. In this sense, histograms and bar charts are similar, except that the categories on the x-axis in the bar chart are not ordered. 

- Converting numeric data to categorical data is an important and widely used step in data analysis since it reduces the complexity (and size) of the data. This aids in the discovery of relationships between features, particularly at the initial stages of an analysis.

### Expected Value:

- A special type of categorical data is data in which the categories represent or can be mapped to discrete values on the same scale.
- The expected value is really a form of weighted mean: it adds the ideas of future expectations and probability weights.


## Key Ideas:

1. Categorical data is typically summed up in proportions, and can be visualized in a bar chart.

2. Categories might represent distinct things (apples and oranges, male and female), levels of a factor variable (low, medium, and high), or numeric data that has been binned.

3. Expected value is the sum of values times their probability of occurrence, often used to sum up factor variable levels.
