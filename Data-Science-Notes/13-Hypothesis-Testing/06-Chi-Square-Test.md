## Chi-Square Test

- Web testing often goes beyond A/B testing and tests multiple treatments at once. 
- The chi-square test is used with count data to test how well it fits some expected distribution.
- The most common use of the chi-square statistic in statistical practice is with r times c (r * c) contingency tables, to assess whether the null hypothesis of independence among variables is reasonable.

**Key Ideas**
- Chi-square statistic : A measure of the extent to which some observed data departs from expectation.
- Expectation or expected : How we would expect the data to turn out under some assumption, typically the null hypothesis.

**Note**

r * c means “rows by columns”—a 2×3 table has two rows and three columns.
