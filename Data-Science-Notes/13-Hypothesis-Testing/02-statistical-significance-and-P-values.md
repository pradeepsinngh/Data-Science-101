## Statistical Significance and P-Values

### What is statistically significance mean?
It's a way statisticians measure whether an experiment (or even a study of existing data) yields a result more extreme than 
what chance might produce. If the result is beyond the realm of chance variation, it is said to be statistically significant and vice-versa.


**Key Terms**

- P-value : Given a chance model that embodies the null hypothesis, the p-value is the probability of obtaining results as unusual or extreme as the observed results.
- Alpha : The probability threshold of “unusualness” that chance results must surpass, for actual outcomes to be deemed statistically significant.
- Type 1 error : Mistakenly concluding an effect is real (when it is due to chance).
- Type 2 error : Mistakenly concluding an effect is due to chance (when it is real).


**Key Ideas**
- Significance tests are used to determine whether an observed effect is within the range of chance variation for a null hypothesis model.
- The p-value is the probability that results as extreme as the observed results might occur, given a null hypothesis model.
- The alpha value is the threshold of “unusualness” in a null hypothesis chance model.
- Significance testing has been much more relevant for formal reporting of research than for data science (but has been fading recently, even for the former).
