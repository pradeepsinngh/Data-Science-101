# Data Science Lifecycle

You can divide any data science project in following steps and at each step you ask many question to yourself and to data, which helpsyou in next steps. And it is quite common for more questions and problems to emerge after the last step of this process, and we can thus repeatedly engage in this procedure to discover new characteristics of our world. This positive feedback loop is so central to any data science project that it is usally called as the **data science lifecycle**.


## Stage 1

**Question/Problem Formulation:**
   * What do we want to know or what problems are we trying to solve?
   * What are our hypotheses?
   * What are our metrics of success?

## Stage 2

**Data Acquisition and Cleaning:**
   * What data do we have and what data do we need?
   * How will we collect more data?
   * Is our data representative?
   * How do we organize the data for analysis?
   * How do we transform or process our data?
   * Structured or Unstructured data?

## Stage 3

**Exploratory Data Analysis:**
   * How is our data organized and what does it contain?
   * What are the biases, anomalies, or other issues with the data?
   * How do we transform the data to enable effective analysis?
   * What relationship features have? Are the related/ correlated to each other?
   
## Stage 4
**Building Models:**
   * What kind of models can you build?
   * Regression/ Classification/ Clustering?

## Stage 4

**Prediction and Inference:**
   * What does the data say about the world?
   * Does it answer our questions or accurately solve the problem?
   * How robust are our conclusions and can we trust the predictions?
