## SQL

SQL (Structured Query Language) is a programming language that has operations to define, logically organize, manipulate, and perform calculations on data stored in a relational database management system (RDBMS).

SQL is a declarative language. This means that the user only needs to specify what kind of data they want, not how to obtain it. An example is shown below, with an imperative example for comparison:

- **Declarative:** Compute the table with columns "x" and "y" from table "A" where the values in "y" are greater than 100.00.
- **Imperative:** For each record in table "A", check if the record contains a value of "y" greater than 100. If so, then store the record's "x" and "y" attributes in a new table. Return the new table.
