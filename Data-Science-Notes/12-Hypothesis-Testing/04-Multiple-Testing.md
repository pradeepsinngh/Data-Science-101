## Multiple Testing:

**Key Terms**
- Type 1 error : Mistakenly concluding that an effect is statistically significant.
- False discovery rate : Across multiple tests, the rate of making a Type 1 error.
- Adjustment of p-values : Accounting for doing multiple tests on the same data.
- Overfitting : Fitting the noise.


**Key Ideas**

- Multiplicity in a research study or data mining project (multiple comparisons, many variables, many models, etc.) increases the risk of concluding that something is significant just by chance.
- For situations involving multiple statistical comparisons (i.e., multiple tests of significance) there are statistical adjustment procedures.
- In a data mining situation, use of a holdout sample with labeled outcome variables can help avoid misleading results.

## Degree of Freedom
- refers to the number of values free to vary. 
- For example, if you know the mean for a sample of 10 values, and you also know 9 of the values, you also know the 10th value.Only 9 are free to vary


**Key Ideas**
- The number of degrees of freedom (d.f.) forms part of the calculation to standardize test statistics so they can be compared 
to reference distributions (t-distribution, F-distribution, etc.).
- The concept of degrees of freedom lies behind the factoring of categorical variables into n â€“ 1 indicator or dummy variables 
when doing a regression (to avoid multicollinearity).
