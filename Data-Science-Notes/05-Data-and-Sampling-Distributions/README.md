## Data and Sampling Distributions:

A popular misconception holds that the era of big data means the end of a need for sampling. 

**Population** in statistics is assumed to follow an underlying but unknown distribution. The only thing available to us is the 
**sample** data and its empirical distribution. To get from the population to the sample, a sampling procedure is used.
