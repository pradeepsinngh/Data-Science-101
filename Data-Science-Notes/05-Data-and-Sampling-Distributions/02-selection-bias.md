## Selection Bias:

Selection bias refers to the practice of selectively choosing data—consciously or unconsciously—in a way that leads to a 
conclusion that is misleading or ephemeral.

1. Bias : Systematic error.
2. Data snooping : Extensive hunting through data in search of something interesting.
3. Vast search effect : Bias or nonreproducibility resulting from repeated data modeling, or modeling data with large numbers of predictor variables.

## Key Ideas:
1. Specifying a hypothesis, then collecting data following randomization and random sampling principles, ensures against bias.

2. All other forms of data analysis run the risk of bias resulting from the data collection/analysis process (repeated running of models in data mining, data snooping in research, and after-the-fact selection of interesting events).
